## login / registration page

> I have tried to use browser's alert and conform function
> I think that there is no need to create additional alert messages. I hope that I have used them not only properly, but also this implementation will be user-friendly.
> Also you will find some basic validation

## 📍 map / table<sup>1</sup>

> Map was created with D3 js and topojson
> for the table I have used [rest countries](https://restcountries.eu/) API.

## 📍 favorites

> all the cards that have got yellow stars will appear in this page
> you will also be able to delete them dynamically without reloading the page

<sup>1\*</sup> Table is nominal name. Don't look for any actual connection between real tables and mine. it just represents all of the cards that are created in the table section.
